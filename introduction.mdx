## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Qolaig's Press Review API. This guide will help you set up and use the API to query articles from various sources.

## Setting Up

To get started, make sure to create your token on your [profile](https://press-review.qolaig.app/profile). If you need help setting up the API endpoints or if you need a quick refresher on prompt engineering techniques, don't hesitate to book a 30 minutes with us: [Calendly](https://calendly.com/gary-i9e/introductory-call).

## Available Sources

When using this API, you can query articles from the following sources:
- Le Monde
- Les Echos

## Plans and Credits

We offer two plans with different credit allocations:

#### Standard Plan
- 50 credits per month

#### Premium Plan
- 150 credits per month

### Credit Usage

1 credit is equivalent to one day when no AI is used (endpoint `articles`). For example, if you want all articles from a specific date, 1 credit will be deducted from your monthly credits.

If you use AI to filter the articles (endpoint `articles_filtered`), 2 credits will be deducted per date.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or would like to recommend additional sources, please get in touch with us at [dev@qolaig.com](mailto:dev@qolaig.com).
